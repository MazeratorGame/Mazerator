Mazerator game for Weekly Game Jam Week #126, but failed to submit on time https://awesomekalin.itch.io/mazerator
If you want to install old versions of Mazerator, goto github.com/Awesome-Arcade/Mazerator-old/releases

# Why I switch to Godot
One reason: Quicker (There are actually more)

# How to build
Open Godot 3.3 (must be this!) then open this project and then goto Project > Export and if you don't have the export templates, download them and then select your platform or what platform you want to build to. Then press Export Project. It may ask you where to export. If you do not do the correct version of godot, I/we will NOT provide support

# Releases page
Please note that releases on the release page aren't full releases! Full releases will have f at the end!!!
